// The single, shared Collie mark: brand + home button + connection loader in one, so the top-left of
// every screen means the same thing. At rest it's the familiar static app icon (favicon.svg); once the
// connection has been not-live for a sustained beat (`trouble`) it springs into the galloping sprite —
// until the outage escalates (`lost`), when it drops the gallop and rests on the SAME static icon,
// muted, then settles back to the full-color icon once live. The rest state is always the static icon,
// never a paused sprite: a gallop strip's rest frame is a full-stretch mid-stride pose that reads as
// frozen mid-run. Tapping it returns to the dashboard. The dashboard shows the "Collie" wordmark too;
// inside a pane the mark stands alone (the breadcrumb carries the context). Both headers render THIS
// component — the consistency is structural, not a convention two files have to keep agreeing on.
