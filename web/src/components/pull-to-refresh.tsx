// It is deliberately NOT on the pane view. A pane's screen is already re-read every 1.5 s from the
// multiplexer's own live grid, and the scroller there is the terminal mirror — a pull at the top of
// it is how you reach older output, which is a different question with a different answer
// ("Load older"). Refreshing is a question about the HERD.
