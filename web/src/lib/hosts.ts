// leads it, what is a host called, and how do you key something per host.
//
// **The whole module answers "no pack" for a solo snapshot.** `servers` is optional-and-absent
// (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §11), so `isMultiHost(undefined)` is false, `hostKey({})` is `""`, and every
// host-qualified key degrades to a pure prefix of what shipped. That is what lets a solo install
// render byte-identically without a single `if (pack)` in a component — the hide rule is data, not a
// mode flag.
//
// React-free on purpose (same reason as lib/scope.ts): the pieces that need React live in
// components/pack-provider.tsx.
