# Third-party notices

## Collie project origin

Nenu originated as a fork of [Collie](https://github.com/AltanS/collie), created by
[Altan Sarisin](https://github.com/AltanS). Collie provided the original Herdr bridge, self-hosted
PWA, Tailscale access, notification system, terminal controls, and much of the repository history
on which Nenu continues to build.

Collie is distributed under the MIT License. Its original copyright and full license terms are
preserved in Nenu's root [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

## T3 Code UI adaptations

Nenu's workbench uses theme values and layout/control styling adapted from
[T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code), commit
`191a4ef754b2e679f74a49230b34b48e42688349`:

- `apps/web/src/index.css`: light/dark surface palette and typography.
- `apps/web/src/components/AppSidebarLayout.tsx` and `sidebar/SidebarChrome.tsx`: sidebar layout.
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/ContextWindowMeter.tsx` and `lib/contextWindow.ts`: context ring and token formatting.
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/ModelListRow.tsx`: native model and reasoning picker row styling.
- `apps/web/src/routes/_chat.index.tsx`: home hero and contextual entry-point styling.
- `apps/web/src/composer-logic.ts` and `apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatComposer.tsx`: provider-aware command completion and insert-only selection.
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/toast.tsx`: compact top-right notification surface and typography.
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/MessagesTimeline.tsx` and `MessagesTimeline.logic.ts`: work grouping, minimal disclosures, separate final answers, and isolated elapsed-time updates.

Adaptations retain Nenu's identity, React Router navigation, Herdr transport,
and guarded terminal input. They do not use T3 Code's orchestration runtime.

## Fonts

DM Sans Variable and JetBrains Mono 400/500 are the fonts selected by T3 Code's
web client. Latin WOFF2 subsets are vendored from Fontsource packages
`@fontsource-variable/dm-sans@5.2.8` and `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono@5.2.8`.
Both use the SIL Open Font License 1.1; complete notices are in
`web/public/fonts/dm-sans-LICENSE.txt` and
`web/public/fonts/jetbrains-mono-LICENSE.txt`. Existing Nerd Font subsets and
`web/public/fonts/LICENSE.txt` remain unchanged.

## PDF.js

The optional document viewer uses Mozilla PDF.js (`pdfjs-dist`), licensed under Apache-2.0.
The full license is distributed at `web/public/pdfjs-LICENSE.txt`. Font and image decoder notices
are also included alongside the lazily served PDF.js resources. See
[PDF.js examples](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/examples/) for the document/page rendering API.
