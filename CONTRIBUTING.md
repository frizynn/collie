# Contributing to Nenu

Thank you for helping improve Nenu. This project controls live terminal panes, so correctness,
privacy, and compatibility take priority over convenience.

## Before opening an issue

- Use [Discussions](https://github.com/frizynn/nenu/discussions) for setup and usage questions.
- Search [Issues](https://github.com/frizynn/nenu/issues) for an existing report.
- Report vulnerabilities privately according to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Remove usernames, hostnames, paths, tokens, pane output, and repository content from logs and images.

## Development setup

Requirements: Bun, Git, and Herdr 0.7.0 or newer. Tailscale is needed only for device testing through
the recommended private-network path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frizynn/nenu.git
cd nenu
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cd web && bun install --frozen-lockfile && cd ..
herdr plugin link "$(pwd)"
```

Run the bridge with `bun run dev`, or exercise the real service path with:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke start --plugin herdr.collie
```

The public name is Nenu. Compatibility identifiers such as `herdr.collie`, `COLLIE_*`,
`collie-ctl.sh`, storage keys, headers, and service names must remain stable unless a migration is
part of an explicitly planned major release.

## Make a focused change

1. Create a branch from current `main`.
2. Add or update tests that prove material behavior.
3. Keep terminal fixtures byte-faithful. Never commit real secrets or private pane content.
4. Update stable documentation when behavior or operator steps change.
5. Add an ADR only for a durable decision that closes off an option contributors will reasonably
   propose again. See [.adr/README.md](.adr/README.md).

For new terminal-agent support, follow [HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md](HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Required checks

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run test
cd web && bun run typecheck && bun run test && cd ..
bun run build
bash scripts/check-version.sh
```

UI changes should also be checked in real Chrome at a phone-sized viewport. Test iPhone safe areas,
keyboard opening, scrolling, drawers, and installed-PWA behavior when the change touches them.

## Versioning and changelog

Nenu follows Semantic Versioning. Maintainer release commits keep these four locations aligned:

- `herdr-plugin.toml`
- `package.json`
- `web/package.json`
- the newest release heading in `CHANGELOG.md`

External pull requests should normally leave versions and `CHANGELOG.md` unchanged; the maintainer
coordinates a release after compatible changes are merged. Describe the user-facing change in the PR
body so it can be included in release notes.

## Pull requests

Use a clear Conventional Commit title. Explain the problem, resulting behavior, validation, and
risk. Include current screenshots for visible UI changes. Keep unrelated refactors separate.
